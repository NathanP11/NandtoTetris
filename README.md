# NandtoTetris
This is a compliation of class work for https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2 (part1 and 2)

The class starts with an elementary Logic gate (Nand Gate) and builds a modern computer. 

Part 1 mostly involved developing Gate logic and utlimately, a Computer (RAM + BUS + CPU)
  Instead of a Tetris game, I wrote a classic Snake game.
  
Part 2 involved writing multiple compilers and an operating system. 
  The OS, and Snake game are writen in a High level Java like language, Jack which is implemented just like Java.

  Java => bytecode Compiler => JVM => Machine Code Compiler => Phone/PC Assembler => Binary
  
  Jack => Jack Compiler          => Jack VM              => VM Translator         => Hack Assembler => Binary


  Implementing every level of this process was a very rewarding experience. It was alot of work over a 3 month period
